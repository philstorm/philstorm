 <b>SUMMARY</b>
 
 <b>PROJECTS</b>
Hi, I‚Äôm Phillip Afuwape ‚Äî a Compliance Analyst and Cybersecurity Professional with over five years of experience aligning technical systems with frameworks like SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR. I specialize in translating complex compliance requirements into clear, actionable strategies that help businesses scale securely and responsibly.

From building AI governance frameworks aligned with NIST AI RMF to developing incident response playbooks and automating audit readiness, I bring both technical depth and strategic vision to every project. I‚Äôve worked across cloud, SCADA, and hybrid environments using tools like Nessus, Splunk, Power BI, and RSA Archer.

I believe compliance is more than checklists ‚Äî it‚Äôs how trust is built in the digital age. This GitHub is where I share real-world deliverables, frameworks, and risk assessments that showcase my commitment to excellence. If you‚Äôre building something that requires trust and security, you‚Äôre in the right place.
